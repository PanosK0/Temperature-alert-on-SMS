# Temperature-alert-on-SMS
With this project you can receive SMS on your phone when a temperature is high.
For example you want to get alerted when the temperature of your freezer is higher than  -10°C or the temperature of the computer room is higher than  40° C.
•	The system reads the temperature from two diferent DHT22 sensors and send SMS if a constant temperature is reached. 
•	Then sends an SMS when the temperature is lowered to normal levels. 
•	Sends SMS on a missed call
Reqirements: Arduino nano, A6 gprs gsm module, 2 DHT22 sensors and a led with a resistor.
